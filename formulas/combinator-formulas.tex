	$$L_{g} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{cont}} L_{i}^{cont} m_{i} - \sum_{ovl \in O} L^{ovl},$$
	
	where
	
	$L_{g}$ -- expected length of the genome,
	
	$N_{cont}$ -- number of contigs,
	
	$L_{i}^{cont}$ -- length of \textit{i}-th contig,
	
	$O$ -- set of overlaps between contigs' starts/ends,
	
	$L^{ovl}$ -- length of overlap \textit{ovl}.\\
	
	$m_{i}$ is multiplicity of \textit{i}-th contig. It is calculated as follows: 
	
	$$m_{i} = \max(\left[\frac{cov_{i}}{cov_{1}}\right], 1),$$  where $cov_{i}$ is coverage of \textit{i}-th contig and $\left[\,\right]$ -- rounding to the nearest integer.
	
	\newpage
	
	$LQ = \frac{n_{a}}{n} \cdot {100}$
	
where $n$ is total number of contog ends (i.e.) number of contigs $\times\;2$, $n_{a}$ is number of adjacent contig ends.
